Re: Trademark Infringement - LUXE ELEGANCE Mark

Dear Sir or Madam:

This firm represents Luxe Fashion Brand LLC, owner of the federally 
registered trademark LUXE ELEGANCE (Reg. No. 5,123,456).

It has come to our attention that you are selling products bearing 
marks confusingly similar to our client's LUXE ELEGANCE trademark.

DEMAND:

1. Immediately cease all use of the infringing marks
2. Remove all infringing products from sale
3. Provide an accounting of all sales
4. Destroy all infringing inventory

Failure to comply within 10 days will result in legal action seeking 
injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees.

Very truly yours,

Lisa Park
Morrison & Blackwell LLP
